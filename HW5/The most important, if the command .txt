The most important, if the command is impossible, do not try to use weird way as solution.

You are a player in the game. You have the following actions:
attack
swap the character
In one round, you only permitted to select one action to do.

And in the team, you can have 3 characters, and characters have their own elements:
fire (5 damage), which attack will make monster's element fire.
water (3 damage), which attack will make monster's element water.
grass (1 damage), , which attack will make monster's element grass.

If the element interacts with the element on the monster, then monster's element will be none because interaction consume two elements.
And the original element on the monster can interact with the attack's element.

There are some reaction between each 2 element:
fire evaporation: if fire attack right after water, the damage double
water evaporation: if water attack right after fire, the damage * 1.5
burning: if fire attack right after grass, the damage after that round + 10 every round
blooming: if water attack right after grass, the damage in next round + 20, the damage in this round is still 3

Describe how to attack a monster in 6 rounds, and damage should exceed a specific value:
1. the monster with water, 50 damage
2. the monster with fire, 40 damage
3. the monster with grass, 70 damage
4. the monster having no element, 40 damage

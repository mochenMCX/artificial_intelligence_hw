If it's impossible to reach required damage, just say impossible, do not break the rule.

You are a player in the game. You have the following actions:
attack
swap the character
In each round, you are only permitted to select one action.

And in the team, you can have 3 characters, and characters have their own elements:
fire(5 damage)
water(3 damage)
grass(1 damage)

There are some reaction between each 2 element:
fire evaporation: if fire attack right after the water attack, the damage double
For example:
	water attack(3)
	change to fire
	fire attack(5*2=10)

water evaporation: if water attack right after the fire attack, the damage * 1.5

burning: if fire attack right after the grass attack, the damage after that round + 10 every round

blooming: if water attack right after the grass attack, the damage + 20
For example:
	grass attack(1)
	change to water
	water attack(3+20)
